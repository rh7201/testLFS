NOTE: 

If it compiles correctly, even when IntelliSense is complaining, do this:

Change to DevelopmentEditor configuration, compile; Change to DevelopmentGame configuration, compile. This gets IntelliSense to recompile and rescan headers and everything works fine again.

This often happens when you alter the lines in your .h code, above the declaration of UCLASS but it can affect other types too.
